- Letter grid with audio playback
- Basic progress tracking
- PWA offline capability
- Subtle animations on letter cards for enhanced user engagement (using `svelte/animate`)

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **User Experience:** Incorporate subtle animations to provide visual feedback and improve engagement without hindering performance.
