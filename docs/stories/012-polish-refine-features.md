# US012: Polish and Refine New Features

## User Story
As a user of Harf Öğren, I want the newly added features for Ottoman Turkish and Persian sets to be polished and refined, so that I have a consistent and high-quality learning experience across all character sets.

## Acceptance Criteria
- All animations should be smooth and performant across all devices
- Code should follow functional programming principles where appropriate
- Responsive design should work consistently across all character sets
- PWA offline capabilities should work properly with the updated structure
- Error handling and fallbacks should work appropriately for all sets

## Technical Requirements
- Refine animations for better performance and smoothness
- Apply consistent functional programming patterns throughout new code
- Ensure responsive design works on all screen sizes for all character sets
- Verify PWA functionality works with updated localStorage structure
- Review and improve error handling in new components and services

## Implementation Notes
- Animation performance should be tested on lower-end devices
- Code quality should follow established patterns in the project
- Consider using libraries like NeverThrow for predictable error flows where appropriate
- All new code should be consistent with existing codebase patterns
- Testing should be comprehensive across all character sets

## Testing
- Verify animation performance on various devices
- Test responsive design on different screen sizes
- Confirm PWA offline functionality works with all sets
- Validate error handling across all new features
- Ensure consistent user experience across all character sets
