# US009: Update Study Mode for Multiple Sets

## User Story
As a user of Harf Öğren, I want the letter learning interface to properly display and handle all character sets (Arabic, Russian, Ottoman Turkish, Persian), so that I can effectively learn from any selected set with the same quality experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The `LetterGrid` component should correctly display letters for any selected set
- The `LetterCard` component should properly render with symbols, names, and learned status for any set
- Audio playback should work correctly for all letters in all sets
- Progress tracking should update properly when letters are marked as learned
- The UI should remain responsive and visually consistent across all sets

## Technical Requirements
- Update LetterGrid component to work with any setId parameter
- Ensure LetterCard component renders correctly for all character sets
- The audio service integration should work with all sets
- Progress tracking integration should update correctly in study mode
- Maintain consistent UI/UX across all character sets

## Implementation Notes
- The LetterGrid component currently handles language parameter, needs to handle setId
- Need to ensure special characters display properly in the UI
- May need to adjust UI styling to accommodate different character shapes
- The progress tracking integration should work seamlessly with new sets
- Audio playback should trigger correctly when letters are clicked

## Testing
- Verify that LetterGrid displays all letters correctly for each set
- Test audio playback for all letters in all sets
- Confirm that progress tracking works during study mode
- Ensure UI remains responsive and visually appealing for all sets
- Test that learned status is properly indicated on letter cards
