# US011: Implement Subtle Animations on Letter Cards

## User Story
As a user of Harf Öğren, I want to see subtle animations on letter cards when they're interacted with or their state changes, so that I get better visual feedback and have an enhanced learning experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Letter cards should include smooth transitions when marked as learned/unlearned
- Hover and click interactions should have subtle visual feedback animations
- The animations should be smooth and not interfere with the learning process
- Animations should be implemented using `svelte/animate` as specified in the architecture
- The animations should follow accessibility guidelines (e.g., respecting reduced motion preferences)

## Technical Requirements
- Implement animations using svelte/animate library
- Use appropriate animation types (fade, flip, etc.) for different interactions
- Ensure animations perform well and don't cause jank
- Respect user preferences for reduced motion
- Maintain all existing functionality while adding animations

## Implementation Notes
- Should add animations for state changes (learned/unlearned)
- Consider adding hover animations for better discoverability
- Click interactions might benefit from subtle feedback animations
- Need to test performance to ensure animations don't slow down the app
- Should consider accessibility and system preferences

## Testing
- Verify animations work correctly when marking letters as learned
- Test that animations don't impact performance
- Confirm animations work well on mobile devices
- Ensure animations respect reduced motion preferences
- Validate that all existing functionality remains intact
