# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
The Harf-Öğren project is a SvelteKit Progressive Web App (PWA) for studying Arabic and Russian letters with audio playback, designed with a mobile-first approach and offline capability.

## Key Knowledge
- Technology stack: SvelteKit 5, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Netlify adapter
- Development environment uses pnpm as the package manager
- The app includes features like language selection (Arabic/Russian), letter grid with audio playback, basic progress tracking and PWA offline capability
- CSS custom properties must be properly wrapped in a `:root` block to avoid build warnings
- The project was initially using a generic Svelte template README which has now been updated to reflect the actual project

## Recent Actions
- Updated the README.md file to accurately describe the Harf-Öğren project instead of the generic Svelte template content
- Fixed CSS optimization warning by properly wrapping CSS custom properties in a `:root` block in `src/app.css`
- Successfully completed a production build without CSS optimization warnings
- The app is configured for deployment to Netlify with offline capability through a PWA implementation

## Current Plan
- [DONE] Update README to reflect actual project
- [DONE] Fix CSS build warnings 
- [IN PROGRESS] Prepare project for production deployment
- [TODO] Configure proper deployment environment (Netlify)
- [TODO] Implement core letter learning features (Arabic and Russian) with audio playback
- [TODO] Further develop responsive UI components for mobile-first experience
