# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Successfully implement and polish features for the Harf Öğren language learning application, specifically focusing on adding support for Ottoman Turkish and Persian character sets with animations, responsive design, and robust error handling across all character sets (Arabic, Russian, Ottoman Turkish, Persian).

## Key Knowledge
- **Technology Stack**: SvelteKit 2.48.0, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Svelte 5.42.2
- **Architecture**: Uses SvelteKit file-based routing with `[setId]` parameter for all character sets
- **Character Sets**: Supports 'ar' (Arabic), 'ru' (Russian), 'ot' (Ottoman Turkish), 'fa' (Persian)
- **Key Components**: LetterCard, LetterGrid, Quiz components with AudioService and QuizService
- **Build Commands**: `npm run build`, `npm test`, `npm run test:unit`
- **Routing**: `/learn/[setId]` and `/quiz/[setId]` routes (previously used 'language' parameter)
- **Audio**: Audio files stored in `static/audio/letters/{setId}/` with fallback mechanisms
- **PWA**: Configured with workbox caching including audio files (.ogg) for offline functionality
- **State Management**: Uses Svelte stores and localStorage with ProgressTracker service

## Recent Actions
### Successfully Implemented Features:
- **[US007 - Update Application Routes]**: Changed from `[language]` to `[setId]` parameter in routing
- **[US008 - Integrate Audio Files]**: Added audio files and mappings for Ottoman Turkish and Persian sets
- **[US009 - Update Study Mode]**: Enhanced LetterGrid and LetterCard components to handle all sets with toggle functionality for learned status
- **[US010 - Update Quiz Mode]**: Updated QuizService and Quiz component to work with all character sets with proper difficulty scaling
- **[US011 - Implement Animations]**: Added smooth fade animations and transitions to LetterCard with reduced motion accessibility support
- **[US012 - Polish and Refine]**: Optimized performance, responsive design, PWA caching, and error handling

### Key Technical Improvements:
- Added `unmarkLetterLearned` functionality to allow toggling of learned status
- Fixed QuizService to handle character sets with fewer letters than difficulty requirements
- Enhanced AudioService with fallback mechanisms and error handling
- Improved responsive grid layouts for better mobile experience
- Updated PWA configuration to cache audio files for offline access
- Added hardware acceleration and optimized animation performance

### Code Quality Enhancements:
- Improved error handling with try-catch blocks and proper fallbacks
- Optimized Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm in QuizService
- Enhanced reactive declarations and variable handling in Svelte components
- Maintained consistent coding patterns across all services

## Current Plan
1. [DONE] Set up project context and understand current architecture
2. [DONE] Implement route updates to use generic `setId` parameter
3. [DONE] Integrate audio files for Ottoman and Persian sets
4. [DONE] Update study mode to handle all character sets properly
5. [DONE] Update quiz mode to work with all character sets and difficulty levels
6. [DONE] Implement subtle animations with accessibility support
7. [DONE] Polish and refine all features with performance optimizations
8. [DONE] Verify PWA functionality and offline capabilities
9. [DONE] Run comprehensive tests and ensure build success

The application now fully supports all four character sets (Arabic, Russian, Ottoman Turkish, Persian) with consistent user experience, animations, responsive design, and offline functionality. All components have been thoroughly tested and polished.
